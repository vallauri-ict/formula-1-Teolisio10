# To make it work
First Download the ZIP file and unzip it wherever you want<br>
Then open `FormulaOneSolution.sln` with Visual Studio<br>
Now choose the project that you want to run<br>
**Remember:** the Database in the `Dati` root must be in `C:\dati` or modify the path in the *DbTool.cs* file and in the *Web.config* file
